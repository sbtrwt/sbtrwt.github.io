                Shobhit Rawat is an accomplished indie game developer with a rich background in both game development and web development. With a strong command of programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, and C++, Shobhit has demonstrated a keen aptitude for creating engaging and immersive gaming experiences.

Beginning his journey in programming during his 12th standard, Shobhit's passion for game development was evident early on as he crafted classics like Tic Tac Toe, Snake Ladder, and Ludo using C++. This early exploration laid the foundation for his future endeavors in the field.

After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, Shobhit embarked on a career with Koyo India (now JTEKT India), where he honed his skills and gained valuable experience in software development. However, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire for new challenges, Shobhit decided to pursue higher studies, qualifying for the Gate exam and pursuing a Master's in Information Technology.

During his academic pursuits, Shobhit delved into Unity game engine, leading to the creation of his first Android game, XBall, in 2017. This marked the beginning of his journey into indie game development. Subsequently, Shobhit transitioned into web development roles, working for companies like Actiknow and Lepton Maps, while also returning to JTEKT India.

Throughout his career, Shobhit's diverse experiences have enriched his understanding of programming and software development. However, driven by a passion for creativity and a desire for new challenges, he made the bold decision to pivot back to game development.

With notable titles such as "Trap the Light," "XBall," and "Zero Effect" under his belt, Shobhit continues to push the boundaries of indie game development, leveraging his extensive knowledge and expertise to create captivating gaming experiences that captivate audiences worldwide. His journey serves as a testament to the power of passion, perseverance, and continuous learning in achieving one's dreams in the dynamic world of game development.
